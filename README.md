If you encounter any tiny to fatal bugs or security vulnerbilites, you can do the following:

1. Go to the [Issues page on this repo](https://github.com/leifadev/scout/issues).
2. Fill out bug report template of what you have encountered
3. Wait up to around 1 - 12 hours and you will likely to get a response. Realistically, I won't think you'll be waiting weeks on end obviously.
