-People, regardless of whether they are students or not, must be given the ability to convey information regarding problems present within the education system and/or what they think should be done to fix certain problems. The information provided by these people must be taken into consideration and they must be given a response of whether the one who the message was meant for are going to take action based on the information provided. If not, the reason(s) as to why must be given. This is necessary in order to determine if the group of people the information was provided to truly pays attention to the information given and does what is logically best. If people wish to gain access to the reason as to why such a group of people who denied to take action based on the information that was given to them these people must be easily able to do so. This too is necessary in order to determine if the group of people the information was provided to truly pays attention to the information given and does what is logically best.
